<h1> Github workflow </h1>

All team members contributing to the code should carefully fellow the steps below:
* Clone the repository.
* Create a new branch from the develop branch and name it according to 
the feature you are implementing example (orm_feature).
* Pull from develop
* After implementing feature in the branch push the branch and do not merge.
* All code merges will be done by the team lead after he/she has made sure 
the newly implemented feature works as required.
* If you have any questions, please reach out to [Ogmaro](ogmaro@gmail.com)
