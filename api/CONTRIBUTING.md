# Github workflow.

## All team members contributing to the code should carefully fellow the steps below

### Clone the repository.

### Create a new branch from the develop branch and name it according to  the feature you are implementing example (orm_feature).

### When you're done with your feature, Pull from the develop branch

### Send a Pull request to develop branch.

### All code merges will be done by the team lead after he/she has made sure the newly implemented feature works as required.
